Automate multitrack podcast editing

#
# This code was written to automate some of the Coffee Break podcast
# most basic editing needs. It involves taking a multi-track
# recording, normalizing, compressing (in our own way, designed for
# multi-track recording of conversations), track mixing and de-noising.
#
# Dependencies (modules available with pip): numpy, soundfile
# External programs required (must be in path): sox, lame
#
